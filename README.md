## Project Plan 

> - Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present
> - Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
> - Examine Irish context (Temperature and Rainfall)
> - Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas 
dataframe and export to csv and json formats
> - Analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between 
them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis)
> - Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to 
published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
> - Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features
