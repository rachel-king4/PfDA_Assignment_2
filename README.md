# PfDA_Assignment_2
Repository for PfDA Assignment 2, Winter 2023.

## **Contents**
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for an analysis of paleo-present climate data project completed for the Programming for Data Analytics Module undertaken as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU, Galway.

## **Project Plan** 
> - Analyse CO₂ vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs – present
> - Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
> - Examine Irish context (Temperature and Rainfall)
> - Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats
> - Analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis)
> - Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO₂ trends continue
> - Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features

## **Running the Notebook**
To run the notebook, "pfda_assignment_2.ipynb" the repository must first be cloned to the user's machine, which can be achieved by following the below instructions:

- First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
    > cd: to change your working directory.

    > cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.

- Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
    > git clone https://github.com/rachel-king4/PfDA_Assignment_2.git

- Any changes made to the remote repository will not automatically sync with the local cloned copy. To update the local directory, navigate to the cloned directory and use this command:
    > git pull

Once the repository is cloned, the cloned directory can be opened and ran in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
